# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my repository containing a collection of sample data science and machine learning projects that I have built. Each project demonstrates my expertise in Python and SQL coding skills, showcasing various aspects of data analysis, predictive modeling, and tackling real-world problems.

## Overview

These projects encompass a diverse array of topics, ranging from analyses of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and A/B testing for mobile apps, predictive modeling and strategies for mitigating data imbalances in machine learning. Additionally, I have worked on projects such as building a crime time and day predictor for the Toronto Police, defining business problems, designing data analytic solutions, and implementing machine learning predictive models.

## Project Highlights

- **Customer Churn Prediction**: Analyzing customer behavior data to predict churn rates and identify factors influencing customer retention.
- **Customer Behavior Analysis**: Utilizing customer data to understand and segment customer behavior patterns.
- **Toronto Police Crime Period Predictor**: Developing a predictive model to forecast crime rates based on time and day, aiding law enforcement in resource allocation and planning.
