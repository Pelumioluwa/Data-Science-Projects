The t-score is the ratio of the difference between the two means. High t-score shows that there is a large difference and a small t-score shows that there are some similarities. From above, we can see that null hypothesis for the control group and both variants needs to be rejected. The means are not the same and there are signitficant differences among the control and variant A and the control and variant B. However, from the test between the variants, we need to accept the null hypothesis for variant A and B as the p-value < 0.05. Therefore, the means are the same. Also, the t-score among both variants is low. So this means there are little to no significant difference between both groups \n"
